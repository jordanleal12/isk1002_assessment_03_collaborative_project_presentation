### Jordan Difficulties Encountered

<!-- Feeling lost on direction of what part of the project to do next. Experiencing bottlenecks sometimes where the application was requiring a specific feature to proceed -->

- As my first time collaborating on a coding project, I experienced many difficulties learning how to work effectively as a team, despite great team mates.

- Specifically there was difficulty with "bottlenecks" in the coding process, and feeling for what part of the project to work on next. For example, when I had planned to work on the 'friendships' controller and routes, the 'friendships' model had yet to be finished, nor had the other remaining models required to work on other unfinished controllers and routes.

- In such instances, I was often left feeling like a boat without a rudder, unsure what to work on next and leaving work unfinished in stale branches.

- These bottlenecks should have been identified and accounted for in our planning process, however as our first large scale Express API and group project, we failed to accurately account for how long certain steps would take, and what tasks should have been prioritized to avoid bottlenecks.

### Proposed Improvements to Communication Process

- If we were to attempt this project again, I would make the following improvements to our communication process.

- Firstly, when initially planning the distribution of work for the 'Planning & Design Documentation' assessment for this MERN project, I created a Google Survey form, covering important information like topic strengths, weaknesses and preferences, availability windows, preferred meeting software etc.

- Prior to commencing the API and React build process, I would undertake this step again. The goal would be to identify which areas each person was strong and weak in, and what parts of the project they wished to work on, as well as other data to facilitate easier communication.

- By doing so we could have helped identified potential weaknesses early and overcome them as a team, preventing bottlenecks occurring as a result.

- We also would have been able to more effectively and thoroughly pre-allocate work for the project, reducing the 'rudderless' feeling of not knowing what to do next.

- Secondly, I would have encouraged early and effective communication when encountering programming issues or difficulties.

- Out of misguided consideration for our team members, each of us at times would get stuck on a particular challenge. Rather than reaching out for help, we would try to deal with the issue alone to avoid slowing down team members.

- Looking back, I would make clear from the beginning that this approach almost always costs the team more time than it saves. Rather than clearing a task quickly with help, attempting to push through alone often just leads to wasted time before requesting help anyway, or holding up other parts of the project relying on current work to be completed.

- An example of this was when I began working on component styling. As Joss had already done a lot of work on this already, and my SCSS skills were rusty, I spent a lot of time trying to refamiliarise myself with SCSS, understand the styling he had implemented, and trying to match it on my own.

- If instead I had rendezvoused with Joss for him to run me through it, I would have far more quickly understood what I needed to do, and avoided some of the minor future styling conflicts we encountered.
