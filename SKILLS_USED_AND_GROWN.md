### Jordan Skill Used

- A skill I brought to this project was testing and test driven development (TDD). The previous Flask API I had built used TDD with 344 total tests, including mocks, integration tests, unit tests, functional tests and security tests.

- This was a skill I had developed further in separate projects and studies, adapting them for use with JavaScript and increasing my testing capabilities

- I brought these skills to this project, especially the API service. By utilizing TDD, we were able to identify bugs and errors early, and provide a structure for what our code needed to achieve.

- I created test fixtures and other test utilities to keep tests dry, and to reduce the overhead for my team members when creating their own tests.

- A combination of unit, integration, end-to-end, and functional tests were written by myself, with my team members contributing by writing tests for code they developed.

- As seen from our coverage report, we were able to achieve 92.6% function coverage across all files, using 10 test suites and 172 tests.

### Jordan Skill Grown

- During the course of this project, I was able to develop my skill in using Axios and Tanstack Query for our frontend React application.

- Axios is a HTTP client library, considered the 'go to' standard for HTTP requests and asynchronous data fetching, especially in React applications.

- Tanstack Query is the most widely used data fetching library in the React ecosystem, used for managing server state, caching, data fetching and invalidating server data in React applications.

- While building our React application, I learned to implement and use Tanstack Query in conjunction with Axios (HTTP client) to handle data fetching, state management and global cache configuration.

- Collaborating with my peers as seen in our discord messages, we identified the pros and cons of implementing these tools together, and shared learning resources to help us build our skills in order to implement these features, such as articles as shown, tutorial videos, and even discussing with LLM's to help understanding the underlying concepts.

- By building my skills in this area, I was able to implement an `apiServices.js` file with axios routes, request and response interceptors, and custom configuration.

- The routes were imported alongside Tanstack Query in our customHooks folder, using custom query and mutation hooks to set conditions for triggering the API calls, caching, and invalidating the data.

- From this process, I was able to grow my skills with these two libraries to a point that I am comfortable using them across any new React project I undertake.
