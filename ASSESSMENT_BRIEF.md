# Assessment Brief

## Brief

**Assessment Purpose**
Presentation of work is one of the most effective ways to communicate your skills & work ethic to your peers & prospective employers. While this may take away from a developer’s development time, it provides a fantastic opportunity for feedback & growth while also allowing a developer to show off & market themselves.

In IT projects, it’s crucial for all professionals involved to have an understanding of their work & how to integrate it with the work of others. This typically takes the form of version control workflows & clear collaborative processes. Importantly, being able to reflect & improve upon a project’s collaborative workflow helps improve the quality of work for all developers involved as well.

To solidify your understanding of collaborative IT projects and collaborative workflows, you should be able to show your ability to reflect upon a project’s development process, version control workflow & analyse its strengths and flaws.

**Assessment Task / Item**
For this assessment, you must submit a ZIP file containing the following:

- A recording of a presentation of a full stack application project
- The slides or other presentation content used in the presentation
  The presentation must demonstrate the full stack application and explain the development process behind that project.

**Assessment Instructions**
This assessment requires you to present and discuss your work on a software project. That project can be one that you have worked on previously, such as a group full stack application project, or one that you created specifically for this presentation.

Either way, the project must’ve been worked on in a collaborative group. Each group member of that project must be a student that is also doing this assessment, and must be available to participate in the presentation (detailed below).

With reference to a group project as noted above, present your work & explain to the audience these key pieces of information:

- The purpose, goal, or problem that the project is addressing
- Use at least one external source or reference that provides relevant information about the purpose, goal, or problem
- How the purpose, goal or problem is being addressed by the project
- The collaborative workflow used by the development team on the project, including information on:
  - The task allocation process within the team
  - The version control workflow used within the team
  - Any difficulties encountered developing the project as a team
  - Anything that could be done differently if the project were to be redone by the team in future as a reasonable improvement to the collaborative workflow

As part of the presentation, each group member must talk about their own:

- Skills used throughout the project
- Skills or experiences gained throughout the project
- At least one feature or piece of application functionality that that team member developed
- At least one problem or hurdle that that team member faced during the project & how it was overcome
- At least one thing that that team member would do differently if given more time or a chance to redo the project

The presentation must Include a walkthrough or showcase of the application and its features and go for no longer than 10 minutes.

Presentation slides containing the above information must be included in the submission in PDF format.
A recording of the presentation must be included in the submission as either:

- A file in a video format, such as MP4.
- A URL to a video hosting platform, such as YouTube or Vimeo.
